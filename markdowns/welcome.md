How to use vue-router is todayâ€™s our most important topic. VueJS is frontend Library which can be used with any backend Languages. If we want to create fully functional front end application, then vue-router and vue-resource are two great pillars in VueJS. So today we will deep dive on vue-router. Routing is the way to manage the components in a Single Page Applications. All the Famous Front End Frameworks utilizes the concept of Routing.

# Step 1: Make one components directory inside your project.

Inside that directory, create three components files. These files are as showing in snippets.

@[Sample Vue.js App]({"stubs": ["components/Home.vue", "components/About.vue", "components/Contact.vue"], "command": "/bin/bash run.sh"})

 # Step 2: Config vue-router module.

 In main.js file first, we need to import a vue-router module from a node_modules folder because we have installed all of our dependencies in this project. Copy the following code into our main.js file.

@[Sample Vue.js App]({"stubs": ["main.js"], "command": "/bin/bash run.sh"})

# Step 3: Our final files would be something like this.

@[Sample Vue.js App]({"stubs": ["main.js", "index.html", "components/Home.vue", "components/About.vue", "components/Contact.vue"], "command": "/bin/bash run.sh"})
